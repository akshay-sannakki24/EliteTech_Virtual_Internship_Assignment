# Caesar Cipher Implementation

This Python script implements a basic Caesar cipher, which is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.



## Features

- Encrypts a message by shifting letters based on user-defined shift value.
- Decrypts the encrypted message using the inverse of the shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving their case.
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.



## Requirements

- Python 3.x



## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using Python:
   - python caesar_cipher.py
4. Follow the prompts to enter a message and a shift value.



## Example
Enter the message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypted message: Hello, World!



## Code Explanation
#### Functions
1. main():
   - Prompts the user to input a message and a shift value.
   - Calls the caesar_cipher function to encrypt the message and then decrypt it.
   - Prints the encrypted and decrypted messages.

2. caesar_cipher(text, shift):
   - Takes a string text and an integer shift as input.
   - Iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is an alphabet letter, it shifts it by the specified amount.
   - Non-alphabet characters are added to the result unchanged.
   - Returns the resulting string.
