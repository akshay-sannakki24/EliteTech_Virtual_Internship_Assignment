# Cyber Security Internship Tasks

This repository includes the tasks I completed during my virtual internship in Cyber Security. 

Each task focuses on a different aspect of cybersecurity and demonstrates various techniques and solutions.

The projects are written in Python and showcase the practical application of security principles.


## Tasks Assigned

#### `Task 01 :  Implement Caesar Cipher`
- Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
#### `Task 02 :  Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption`
- Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation.
- The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing operations like swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel.
#### `Task 03 :  Password Complexity Checker`
- Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- The tool provides feedback on the password's strength.
#### `Task 04 :  Simple Keylogger`
- Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes.
- The keylogger logs the keys pressed and saves them to a file.
- Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.
#### `Task 05 :  Network Packet Analyzer`
- Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets.
- The tool displays relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.
- This tool is intended for educational use only.
